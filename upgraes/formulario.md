          No fields are strictly required by the API. For example, it is valid
          to create a customer without a first name, last name, or residential
          address, but this customer will not be granted endorsements required
          to transact on Bridge until the necessary information is provided,
          possibly via a PUT request.

              The `type` provided determines whether you are submitting a tax
              identification number or some form of government-issued ID.


              Reference these lists for tax identification numbers by country:
              [Individuals](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/individual-tax-identification-numbers-by-country),
              [Businesses](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/business-tax-identification-numbers-by-country)


              Here is the list of acceptable government issued id documents:
              `drivers_license`, `matriculate_id`, `military_id`,
              `permanent_residency_id`, `state_or_provincial_id`, `visa`,
              `national_id`, `passport`


              All customers must provide at least one Tax Identification Number
              for their issuing country. If a country cannot be found, please
              select `other` and ensure the `description` field is provided.


              Non-U.S. `individual` customers and associated persons must
              include a combination of at least one Tax Identification Number
              and at least one photo id document such as a `passport` (with
              `image_front`) or a government-issued `drivers_license`. If the
              photo id document used is also a valid tax identification number
              (like a national id), it can be submitted as a single object in
              the `identifying_information` array; otherwise, a valid tax
              identification number must also be submitted as a separate object
              in the `identifying_information` array.
